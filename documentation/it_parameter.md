# Number of Iterations Parameter in PTZJEPA

In PTZJEPA, the `-it` or `--iterations` parameter controls how many complete PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera positioning rounds will be executed during operation. It's defined in the argument parser with a default value of 10:

```python
parser.add_argument(
    "-it",
    "--iterations",
    help="An integer with the number of iterations (PTZ rounds) to be run (default=10).",
    type=int,
    default=10,
)
```

This parameter has different effects depending on the run mode:

1. **During PTZ camera operation** (`operate_ptz`): Determines how many complete rounds of camera movements will be performed when collecting images.

2. **In dreamer mode**: Controls how many cycles of dream generation the system will perform:
   ```python
   def dreamer_wrapper(arguments):
       operate_ptz(arguments)
       prepare_images()
       number_of_iterations = 10  # This can be overridden by arguments.iterations
       for itr in range(number_of_iterations):
           run_jepa(arguments.fname, "dreamer")
   ```

3. **In lifelong learning**: Affects sub-cycles of camera operations within the continuous learning loop.

Setting this parameter appropriately helps balance data collection needs with computational resources - higher values collect more diverse camera angles but require more processing time.

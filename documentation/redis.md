# Redis Locker System in PTZJEPA

The PTZJEPA project uses a Redis-based distributed locking system implemented in redis_cli.py to coordinate access to shared resources across multiple nodes.

## Redis Locker Implementation

The implementation consists of the `MultiLockerSystem` class which:

1. **Establishes Redis Connection**:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, redis_host, redis_port, redis_password, locker_prefix, num_lockers, expire_in_sec=1800, acquire_timeout=10):
       self.redis = redis.Redis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, password=redis_password, db=0)
   ```

2. **Provides Lock Management**:
   - `acquire_locker(locker_num)`: Attempts to obtain a named lock
   - `release_locker(locker_num)`: Releases a previously acquired lock
   - Uses unique UUIDs to ensure locks are only released by the process that acquired them
   - Implements automatic lock expiration (default: 30 minutes)

## Redis Server Configuration

While the code doesn't explicitly show the Redis server host information in the provided files, the Redis server appears to be:

1. **Hosted on the distributed server** specified in the command line arguments:
   ```python
   parser.add_argument(
       "-dist_ip",
       "--distributed_ip",
       type=str,
       default="130.202.23.67",  # Default distributed server IP
       help="The ip of the distributed server."
   )
   ```

2. **Connection Details**: The Redis connection parameters (host, port, password) are likely passed to the `MultiLockerSystem` constructor when it's instantiated elsewhere in the codebase, potentially in the `run_jepa.py` or other modules that work with distributed resources.

3. **Purpose**: The Redis locker enables multiple nodes to coordinate access to shared models and resources by:
   - Preventing race conditions when updating shared models
   - Allowing nodes to see which models are currently in use
   - Implementing timeouts to recover from node failures

This distributed locking mechanism works in conjunction with the SSHFS mounting system to enable coordinated access to shared files across multiple nodes in the PTZJEPA infrastructure.

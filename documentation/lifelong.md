# Lifelong Learning Mode - Continuous Operation

No, in the 'lifelong' learning mode, the code is **designed to run indefinitely** and should never stop on its own.

Looking at the implementation in main.py:

```python
def lifelong_learning(arguments):
    operate_ptz(arguments)
    while True:  # <-- Infinite loop with no exit condition
        prepare_images()
        training_complete = run_jepa(arguments.fname, "world_model")
        training_complete = run_jepa(arguments.fname, "dreamer")
        training_complete = run_rl(arguments.fname, "train_agent")
        interaction_complete = env_inter(arguments, arguments.fname, "navigate_env")
```

The function uses an unconditional `while True:` loop with:
- No break statements
- No exit conditions
- No termination checks

This is by design - lifelong learning mode represents continuous operation where the system keeps learning from its environment indefinitely, cycling through:
1. Data collection
2. World model updating
3. Dream generation
4. Agent training
5. Environment interaction

The only way it would stop is through:
- Manual intervention (Ctrl+C)
- System shutdown
- An unhandled exception crash
- External process termination

This persistent operation aligns with the goal of creating an autonomous system that continuously improves its understanding of the environment.

# Migrating PTZJEPA from Ethernet to 5G Connectivity

Shifting the PTZJEPA system from Ethernet to 5G would impact operations in several ways due to the different network characteristics. Here's what you should consider:

## Expected Network Behavior Changes

1. **Variable Latency**: 
   - 5G may introduce more variable latency compared to Ethernet
   - This affects distributed Redis locking and SSHFS operations

2. **Bandwidth Considerations**:
   - 5G bandwidth can be high but often has data caps or throttling
   - Model transfers (300-400MB) might be affected depending on your 5G plan

3. **Connection Reliability**:
   - 5G connectivity might experience more interruptions
   - Cell signal strength variations could affect long-running operations

## Code Modifications Needed

### 1. Adjust Timeouts in Redis Client

```python
class MultiLockerSystem:
    def __init__(self, redis_host, redis_port, redis_password, locker_prefix, num_lockers, 
                 expire_in_sec=1800, 
                 acquire_timeout=30):  # Increase from 10 to 30 seconds
        # ...existing code...
```

### 2. Add Robust Retry Logic to SSHFS Mounter

```python
class SSHFSMounter:
    # ...existing code...
    
    def mount(self):
        max_retries = 5
        retry_delay = 10  # seconds
        
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                # Existing mount code
                success = subprocess.call(mount_command, shell=True) == 0
                if success:
                    return True
                
                logger.warning(f"Mount attempt {attempt+1} failed, retrying in {retry_delay}s...")
                time.sleep(retry_delay)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Mount exception: {e}")
                time.sleep(retry_delay)
                
        return False
```

### 3. Implement Connection Monitoring

Add a network health monitoring service to detect and respond to 5G connectivity issues:

```python
def monitor_connection(host, check_interval=60):
    """Monitor connection health and log issues"""
    while True:
        metrics = log_network_metrics(host)
        if metrics['packet_loss_pct'] > 10 or metrics['latency_ms'] > 500:
            logger.warning(f"Network degradation detected: {metrics}")
            # Could trigger reconnection logic here
        time.sleep(check_interval)
```

### 4. Optimize Transfer Sizes

Consider implementing chunked transfers or compression for large model files:

```python
# Pseudocode for model saving optimization
def save_checkpoint_compressed(model, optimizer, path):
    checkpoint = {
        'model': model.state_dict(),
        'optimizer': optimizer.state_dict(),
    }
    torch.save(checkpoint, path, _use_new_zipfile_serialization=True)
```

## Configuration Changes

1. **Add 5G-specific Parameters**:
   ```bash
   python /app/main.py -rm lifelong -dist -tp \
     -network_type 5g \
     -connection_retry_attempts 5 \
     -connection_timeout 30 \
     ...other parameters...
   ```

2. **Monitor Data Usage**:
   Track data transfer volumes to avoid exceeding 5G data caps:
   ```python
   # Add to network_monitor.py
   def log_data_usage(transfer_size_bytes):
       with open('/persistence/data_usage.log', 'a') as f:
           f.write(f"{datetime.now()},{transfer_size_bytes}\n")
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test the system under simulated 5G conditions using traffic shaping:
   ```bash
   # Simulate 5G characteristics on test environment
   tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 50ms 20ms distribution normal loss 1%
   ```

2. Implement incremental deployment, testing one node on 5G while keeping others on Ethernet initially

The PTZJEPA architecture should work over 5G with these modifications, as its distributed design already accommodates network separation. The main challenge will be maintaining stability during model transfers and Redis operations when network conditions fluctuate.

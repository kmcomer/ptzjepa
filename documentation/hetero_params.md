# Effects of Heterogeneous Parameters Across PTZJEPA Nodes

When nodes in a distributed PTZJEPA setup run with different parameters (like number of iterations or movements), several important effects can occur:

## Data Collection Imbalance

- **Volume Differences**: Nodes with higher iterations/movements collect more images
- **Environmental Coverage**: Different parameters lead to varying spatial coverage patterns
- **Example**: A node with `-it 20 -mv 20` (400 total movements) will collect approximately twice as many images as one with `-it 10 -mv 20` (200 total movements)

## Training Contribution Disparity

In distributed mode (`-dist`), these differences affect how nodes contribute to shared models:

```
Node A (-it 20)  ----[more updates]----> Shared Models <----[fewer updates]---- Node B (-it 10)
```

- Nodes completing more iterations contribute more training examples
- Nodes with fewer iterations/movements update shared models less frequently
- The Redis locking system prevents simultaneous updates but doesn't enforce balanced contributions

## Exploration Strategy Differences

- **RL Agent Behavior**: Different movement counts affect exploration patterns
- Nodes with more movements per iteration allow agents to develop more complex strategies
- Nodes with fewer movements might optimize for more immediate rewards

## System Coordination

The distributed architecture handles parameter differences through:

1. **Asynchronous Updates**: Nodes operate independently at their own pace
2. **Lock Management**: The Redis locker prevents update collisions
3. **Model Sharing**: All nodes eventually benefit from discoveries made by others

## Recommendations

If running with heterogeneous parameters:

- **For Deliberate Specialization**: Use different parameters to let some nodes focus on exploration (higher movements) and others on exploitation
- **For Balanced Learning**: Use consistent parameters across nodes
- **For Maximum Coverage**: Consider assigning different physical regions to different nodes while keeping parameters consistent

The system will continue to function with heterogeneous parameters, but understanding these dynamics helps in optimizing your specific deployment scenario.

# Reinforcement Learning Agent's Objective Function

The objective function for the reinforcement learning agent is defined in the `loss_fn` function within the `agent_model` function in run_rl.py around line 470:

```python
def loss_fn(state_action_values, expected_state_action_values):
    criterion = torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss()
    loss = criterion(state_action_values, expected_state_action_values.unsqueeze(1))
    return loss
```

This loss function:

1. Uses the Huber loss (`SmoothL1Loss`), which is more robust to outliers than mean squared error
2. Compares the agent's predicted state-action values against the expected state-action values

The expected values are calculated in the `optimize_model` function using the Bellman equation:

```python
# Compute the expected Q values
expected_state_action_values = (next_state_values * GAMMA) + reward_batch
```

Where:
- `GAMMA` is the discount factor (0.99)
- `next_state_values` are obtained from the target network using a max operation
- `reward_batch` contains the immediate rewards

This follows a Q-learning approach where the agent tries to minimize the difference between its current Q-value predictions and the target values based on the reward and estimated future returns.

# PTZJEPA: Objective Function & Node Behavior

## The Objective Function

The RL agent's objective function uses Huber loss (SmoothL1Loss) to minimize the difference between:
- **Predicted state-action values**: The agent's estimate of value for each action
- **Expected state-action values**: Target values calculated using the Bellman equation

What this function actually measures is **prediction error for world model uncertainty**. The unique aspect is that:

> "The agent generates sequences of actions which are difficult for the world model to predict. The agent learns to move the camera to positions in which the world model has poor performance."

This creates an "artificial curiosity" system where **higher rewards come from situations where the world model struggles to predict outcomes**.

## Intended Node Operation

A PTZJEPA node is designed to:

1. **Collect camera data** through PTZ camera positioning
2. **Train a world model** (JEPA) that predicts future states
3. **Generate "dreams"** - simulated experiences using the world model
4. **Train an RL agent** that maximizes uncertainty/difficulty for the world model
5. **Allow agent-controlled exploration** where the camera moves to positions that challenge the world model

This creates a continuous improvement loop where the world model and agent mutually improve each other.

## Expected Node Behavior

In operation, a node will:

1. **Actively seek novelty**: The camera will move toward areas where the world model struggles to make accurate predictions
2. **Balance exploration/exploitation**: The code shows an 80/20 split between exploiting high-value actions and random exploration
3. **Constantly adapt**: As the world model improves in certain regions, the agent will find new challenging viewpoints

## Design vs. Actuation

The design principles and actual implementation align well:

- **Design**: Create a self-improving system where curiosity drives data collection
- **Actuation**: The PTZ camera physically moves based on the agent's decisions

The implementation in env_interaction.py shows how agent decisions directly translate to camera movements:
```python
pan=next_action[0]*pan_modulation
tilt=next_action[1]*tilt_modulation
zoom=next_action[2]*zoom_modulation

set_relative_position(camera=Camera1, args=args, 
                      pan=pan, tilt=tilt, zoom=zoom)
```

This creates an autonomous system that efficiently explores its environment to maximize learning potential through curiosity-driven exploration.
